   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

## 3. Update Email Settings

Open `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` and update:

// Line 22: Replace with your actual email
to: ['your-email@example.com'], // Change this to your email address
```

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to send email"**
   - Check your API key is correct
   - Verify the API key is set in environment variables
   - Check the server console for detailed error messages

2. **Form not submitting**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Verify the API route is accessible at `/api/contact`

3. **Not receiving emails**
   - Check spam folder
   - Verify the `to` email address is correct
   - Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

### Debug Mode:
Add this to your API route for debugging:
```typescript
console.log('Form data received:', { name, email, message });
console.log('Resend response:', { data, error });
```

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Your contact form is now fully functional with email capabilities. Users can reach out to you directly through your portfolio, and you'll receive their messages in your inbox with the ability to reply directly.
