### Future Blog Posts
🎯 **Two Ways** to add feedback to new blog posts:

#### Option 1: Use BlogLayout Component (Recommended)
```tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import BlogLayout from '@/components/blog-layout';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  // your metadata
};

export default function YourBlogPost() {
  return (
    <BlogLayout
      blogSlug="your-blog-slug"
      blogTitle="Your Blog Title"
      publishDate="Dec 20, 2024"
      coverImage="/blog-covers/your-image.jpg"
      readTime="5 min read"
      category="Your Category"
    >
      <div className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-6">
        {/* Your blog content here */}
      </div>
    </BlogLayout>
  );
}
```

#### Option 2: Manual Addition
```tsx
import BlogFeedback from '@/components/blog-feedback';

// In your blog component, before the footer:
<div className="mt-12">
  <BlogFeedback 
    blogSlug="your-blog-slug"
    blogTitle="Your Blog Title"
  />
</div>
```
