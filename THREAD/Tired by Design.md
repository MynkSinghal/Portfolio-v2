🔥 Tired all the time?
It’s not just your job.
It’s your city.
From traffic to toilets — Indian cities are designed to drain you.
Here’s how poor urban planning quietly exhausts 1.4 billion people.
(1/n)



Our cities weren’t built for people.
They were built for vehicles.
Try walking in most Indian towns — it’s cracked footpaths, honking chaos, and zero safety.
Speed won. Safety lost.
(2/n)



Your 2-hour daily commute?
That’s not just time lost.
It’s health lost, joy lost, peace lost.
And if you’re a woman?
Every ride = risk.
Indian commuting isn’t movement. It’s mental taxation.
(3/n)



Need a break?
Too bad.
Benches? Rare.
Public toilets? Scarce.
Shade? Only if a tree escaped the axe.
Our cities are built for motion, not pause.
Stillness is punished.
(4/n)



Disabled? Elderly? Pregnant?
Good luck.
No ramps. No rails. No access.
Cities assume strength and youth.
Forget inclusion — they’re barely functional.
(5/n)



Poor design isn’t cheap.
It costs us:
– More hospital visits
– Fewer work hours
– Lost mobility for women, elders, kids
The real price of planning is what we lose daily.

Look closer.
Some neighborhoods have footbridges, footpaths, flyovers.
Others don’t even have drains.
Cities don’t serve people equally.
They serve power.

So ask yourself:
What would our cities look like…
if we built them for humans, not traffic?
