👀 Think LinkedIn is the game?

In India, 85-93% of jobs never touch it.

Hiring happens in living rooms, panwaadi shops, and WhatsApp groups.

If you’re not in the loop, you’re invisible.

🔄 “Referral beats résumé. Every. Single. Time.”

A cook brings a cleaner. The watchman’s cousin becomes the new guard.

It’s not informal, it’s the original Indian hiring app.

💥 400 million+ Indians work outside the “system.”

💬 WhatsApp groups are India’s true HR.
 
“Need maid? Ping the group.”

Referrals move faster than any app.

A living, breathing, trust-powered network — no login required.

👩 Women run this economy.

SEWA’s 3.2M members, 18 states, zero résumés.

Domestic work is built on society whispers, not job fairs.

Referral isn’t just hiring, it’s the safety net.

💥 Why do apps fail?

Trust isn’t built on ratings.

Speed matters when you need a job tomorrow, not next week.
 
“Kaam dekha hai?” > “degree kya hai?”

The watchman’s word is the only background check.

🍔 Formalization is coming: e-Shram, ONDC, new labour codes.

But the hiring style? Still chai, still WhatsApp, still “kaam dekha hai?”

India’s future of work is digital, but the soul stays human.
