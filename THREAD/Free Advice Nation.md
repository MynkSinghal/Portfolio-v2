In India, you don’t need a therapist, mentor, or consultant.

You just need to exist.

Because here, everyone’s an expert — and they’ll advise you whether you want it or not.

Here’s why India runs on free advice👇

🎙️ Your barber isn’t just cutting your hair.

He’s fixing your love life, career, and cholesterol levels.

In India, every service comes with life gyaan, No extra charge.

Uncle at the tea stall?
Career counselor.

Auto driver?
Stock market analyst.

Local chemist?
Marriage therapist with free paracetamol.

This isn’t randomness. It’s a social system.

Why so much advice?

Because here, privacy is optional, but care is mandatory.

People give advice because they feel responsible for you.

Even if you’re just buying shampoo.

India’s education isn’t just textbooks.

It’s oral wisdom, passed over cutting chai and paan shops.

Stories, lectures, and thoda unsolicited opinion, that’s how we learn.

(5/n)

We confuse advice with connection.

In small towns, advice is currency.

A way to say:
“I see you.”
“I’ve been there.”
“Let me help, even if you didn’t ask.”

But not all advice is equal.

The system has biases.

Older > younger.
Men > women.
Louder > quieter.

Unasked guidance can quickly become unearned authority.

Still, it fills a gap.

In a country where formal mentorship is rare, informal consultants step in.

Sometimes annoying.
Sometimes useful.

But always - always - present.

We don’t Google “How to fix this.”

We ask our barber, our chemist, our cabbie.

And somewhere between the chai and the traffic,
a real insight does land.

That’s India’s “advice economy.”

(9/n)

It’s not CRM.
It’s not LinkedIn.
It’s real human bandwidth, running on nosiness, experience, and emotional impulse.
Chaotic. Kind. Unfiltered.
That’s our default mode.
