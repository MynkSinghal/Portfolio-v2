🔥 Before Netflix, India didn’t binge-watch.
It *waited.*
Every Sunday morning, the whole nation paused for a show.

Here’s how India’s watching habits changed — and what we lost in the process.

📺 The TV wasn’t a screen.
It was a shrine.

Families gathered. Neighbours brought stools.
One show = one colony watching together.
Ramayan on Sundays felt like a national festival.

Now? You watch in bed. Alone.

🧒 Cartoons weren’t “content.”
They were imagination, morality, and magic.

Shaktimaan taught right from wrong.
Shaka Laka Boom Boom made dreams tangible.
Every show felt like a *message with meaning.*

🎵 Even ads were events.
Washing Powder Nirma. Dhara’s jalebi boy. Fevicol. Dairy Milk.

You didn’t skip them.
You *sang them*. You *felt* them.

Today’s 5-sec skippables can’t match that emotional grip.

🎤 Reality shows = real emotions.
Indian Idol. KBC. DID.

You didn’t just watch.
You *voted*. You *cried*. You felt like family.

“SMS karo apne sapne jeetne ke liye”
Now it's: “Next episode in 5 seconds.”

📡 Cable killed collectiveness.
DTH gave every room its own remote.

Dad = sports.
Mom = serials.
Kids = cartoons.

And just like that — shared TV time fragmented into solo screen time.

📲 Then came Jio. And OTT.

Suddenly, 1 screen turned into 1B phones.
TV left the living room.
Now it lives in your pocket.

Binge. Alone.
No waiting. No family. No ritual.

👀 TV used to be about *togetherness*.
Today, it’s just *convenience*.

From “Sab saath baith ke dekhenge”
To “Tu dekh le, mujhe mat bataana spoiler”

We gained access.
But lost connection.

🧠 Content changed.
But so did *how* we consume.

From:
— Scheduled shows → Infinite scroll
— Joint watching → Solo streams
— Shared emotion → Personalized algorithm

This wasn’t just media evolution.
It was a cultural shift.

📚 What we lost:
— The joy of waiting
— The power of ritual
— The warmth of shared emotion
— A generation raised by *one* story at a time

Now?
We’re alone.
Scrolling. Drowning in choice.
