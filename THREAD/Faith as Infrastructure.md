**🛕 Temples don’t just serve God.
They serve 100 million Indians — daily.
From langars to ₹10 sabjis, India’s real welfare isn’t run by the state.
It’s run by faith.**

**The Golden Temple in Amritsar feeds 100,000 people every single day.

No subsidy.
Just stainless steel plates and pure operations.**

**Gurudwaras became India’s emergency kitchens during COVID.
Police, migrant workers, slum dwellers — all fed without a form.
No OTP. No app. Just roti and warmth.**

**Temples offer water.
Shelter.
Shade.
Sometimes even free medical camps.
They don’t call it “service delivery.”
They just call it “seva.”**

**Chennai’s Amma Canteens serve full meals for ₹10.
Inspired by temple kitchens.
No margin. No upsell. No branding.
Just the belief that *food = dignity*.**

**India has no universal meal scheme for adults.
But temples, mosques, churches, and gurudwaras?
They’ve been running one for centuries.
Decentralized. Local. Human.**

**Faith institutions don’t just preach.
They:
– Feed cities
– Employ workers
– Host relief camps
– Provide mental and social safety
In India, faith is infrastructure.**

**We always ask: “Why isn’t the government doing more?”
But here’s the real question:
If a gurudwara can serve 100,000 daily —
what’s stopping the state?**
