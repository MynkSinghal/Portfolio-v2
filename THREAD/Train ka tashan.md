🚉 Indian trains don’t just move people.
They carry dreams, dabbas, vendors, gossip, class divides — and India’s soul.
This isn’t a transport system. It’s a moving sociology lesson.

Here’s how Indian Railways *actually* runs India.

🛏 Sleeper class isn’t just a coach.
It’s India’s middle-class theatre.
Spilled chai. Steel tiffins. Cracked windows. Snoring uncles.
A 16-hour crash course in **trust, tolerance, and thermocol pillows**.

🥚 The pantry guy? The egg puff vendor?
They aren’t staff — they’re part of the train’s **unofficial microeconomy**.
Every ride funds thousands of small businesses — one chai at a time.

🧳 Trains are India’s **migration lifeline**.
From Bihar to Surat. UP to Punjab.
Students, workers, dreamers — packed into General class — chasing survival, not scenery.

They’re not just commuting. They’re *relocating futures*.

👑 First AC to General — Indian trains **literally sell class**.
Your berth decides legroom, lighting, safety, and sometimes dignity.
Same destination, 6 levels of inequality.
That’s India in motion.

🪑 Where else can a tech CEO, a CRPF jawan, and a temple-going dadi sit cross-legged across each other and share mango pickle?
Trains break barriers. But only for a moment.

By the next stop, class creeps back in.

🧼 The real unsung heroes?
Train station cleaners. Bedroll guys. The guy yelling “garam chaiii.”
They’re India’s service class — keeping things moving, cleaning up what gets left behind.

🧍‍♀️ Indian trains also tell stories of **gendered navigation**.
Where to sit. Who to avoid. What to pretend not to hear.
Mobility isn't just distance — it’s a dance with discomfort for every woman onboard.

🧘🏽‍♂️ But there’s magic too.
The stranger who offers paratha. The aunty who watches your bags.
The toddler giggling under the middle berth.
You arrive tired — but oddly restored.

🧠 Indian Railways isn’t just a ministry.
It’s a mood, a memory machine, a mobile economy.
It connects not just cities — but **stories**.

If you want to study India, don’t start with a textbook.
Start with a ticket.
