America’s new rule:
Deport first, ask questions never.

Legal visa holders are being kicked out for old parking fines.

It’s a tightrope.

Welcome to the “Catch & Revoke” era.

1 traffic stop = ICE attention.

1 police interaction = red flag.

Even if charges are dropped.

You’re not safe - you’re scanned.

AI is now your immigration officer.

The US govt is using AI to monitor social media, likes, and posts.

Liked a protest post? You’re flagged.

Your Instagram = background check.

The mastermind? Stephen Miller.

ICE now has daily arrest quotas:
3,000 people/day.

Legal? Illegal? Doesn’t matter.

If you’re brown and unlucky, you’re a number.

America’s irony: deporting the people who build its future.

• H-1Bs create 2-3 US jobs each
• Indian founders created 1M+ jobs
• Indian immigrants add $300B+ to US GDP

When you Deport builders, You Import decline.
