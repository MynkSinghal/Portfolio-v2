🧵 Indian Queue Logic: Why We Never Really “Stand in Line”

It’s not disorder. It’s dynamic optimization.

A live-action puzzle where space, urgency, and hierarchy collide.

Let’s decode the hidden system behind India’s “lines.”

(1/n)

In India, queues aren’t lines.

They’re flows — constantly shifting based on urgency, awareness, and instinct.

You don’t stand still.

You calculate.
You adjust.
You survive.

(2/n)

When things feel scarce-

- Train tickets
- Temple darshan
- Sale at Big Bazaar

Patience feels dangerous.

So the elbow economy takes over.

You don’t wait. You edge in.

What the West calls “line-cutting”…

We call:
“Bas poochhne aaya tha”
“Uncle mujhe pehle jana hai”
“Just two minutes, bhaiya!”

It’s not rude.

It’s tactical.

You’re negotiating access  in real time.

(4/n)

Queues in India are governed by entitlement, not order.

Age. Authority. Locality.

Someone always knows someone.

There’s no system stronger than:

“Mere bhai ka dost hai andar.”

(5/n)

This isn’t chaos.
It’s choreographed crowdwork.

Each person is calculating:
🧠 Who’s distracted?
👀 Can I slip through?
👣 How close is too close?

It’s human Tetris  and everyone’s playing.

(6/n)

Not all queues are vertical.

Some are horizontal surges.

Boarding a bus?
Grabbing prasad?

It’s not “next”, it’s “nearest.”

Claim your space.
Or lose your chance.

(7/n)

Even tech didn’t fix it.

IRCTC? Mash refresh.
Passport Seva? Book at 2 AM.
WhatsApp deliveries? “Bhaiya bas ek dal dena.”

Digital India still queues like Analog India,
just with faster fingers.

(8/n)

So no  we don’t “stand in line.”

We improvise.
We adapt.
We optimize.

Our queues don’t follow rules.

They reflect realities.
