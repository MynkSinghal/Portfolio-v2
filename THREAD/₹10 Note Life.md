💸 A ₹10 note is poor man's UPI.
Ignored by banks, worshipped by sabziwalas, folded 1000 times — never replaced.
This is the secret life of India’s most hardworking note.

🛠️ ₹10 is born in RBI’s printing presses — not plastic, but cotton-soaked cloth.
It’s printed with care…
Only to end up crushed in someone’s blouse or autorickshaw dashboard.

🏦 It enters circulation through banks — but here’s the twist:
ATMs *hate* ₹10 notes.
They jam machines, take too much space, and aren’t “cost-effective.”

So guess where they go?
Your local chai tapri.

🍵 From mandis to metro trains, this note is *everywhere*.
Chai stalls, paan shops, school canteens.
It *flows* where QR codes don’t.
Not flashy — but functional.

🔁 Vendors *prefer* ₹10 notes.
Digital is great, but what if signal’s gone? Or the uncle doesn’t know how to “scan”?
₹10 is instant. Tangible. Trustable.

It makes small biz run without any app update.

📉 Everyone talks about UPI.
But ₹10 cash demand is RISING.
India is *short* by 500+ crore notes.
Even RBI brought back ₹10 coins — people still don’t like them.

They want the note. Not the metal.

🖊️ ₹10 isn’t just money.
It’s a notepad. A bookmark. A message board.
People scribble grocery lists, phone numbers, even mantras on it.

No other object carries such casual intimacy.

♻️ After 3–5 years, the note dies.
Banks sort them. RBI shreds them.
No recycling. Just quiet disappearance.

No one thanks it.
But for years, it held India’s informal economy together.

💥 In the battle between code and cash, ₹10 survives not because it’s smart —
But because it’s *understood.*
It’s not “legacy.”
It’s *infrastructure.*

A living, breathing node in India’s daily trade.
