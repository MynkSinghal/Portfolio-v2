              Picture this: 13-year-old me discovering the {parseText("<bold>art of the flip</bold>")} when I sold Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Budokai 2 in 2009 on eBay. {parseText("<italic>That first sale hit different</italic>")} â€” like finding a rare drop in your favorite game.

              What started as pocket money turned into my {parseText("<bold>high school empire</bold>")}. Scaled that hustle to {parseText("<bold>$100K/year</bold>")} by expanding the catalog â€” think of it as building my own marketplace before I even knew what {parseText("<bold>React</bold>")} or {parseText("<bold>APIs</bold>")} were.

              Most recently, I founded {parseText("<bold>buildspace</bold>")} â€” imagine the largest creative writing workshop, but for builders. We weren't just teaching; we were {parseText("<italic>cultivating a vibe</italic>")} where YouTube creators, EDM producers, and startup founders all shared the same energy.

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              The numbers were {parseText("<bold>wild</bold>")}: scaled nights & weekends online to {parseText("<bold>100,000+ students</bold>")}, raised from {parseText("<bold>a16z/YC</bold>")} (yeah, that happened), built a physical campus in SF that felt like a creative monastery, grew content that reached {parseText("<bold>millions</bold>")}, and shipped an {parseText("<bold>AI social product</bold>")} using {parseText("<bold>Next.js</bold>")}, {parseText("<bold>Python</bold>")}, and {parseText("<bold>PostgreSQL</bold>")} to help people find their creative tribe.

              Five years of pure {parseText("<bold>flow state</bold>")}. But sometimes the best songs end at their peak. I made the tough call to close it down. Here's a

              Buildspace was {parseText("<bold>magic</bold>")}. Like that perfect playlist that just gets you. If you were part of it â€” {parseText("<bold>thank you</bold>")}. You literally changed our lives.

              Founded {parseText("<bold>zipschool</bold>")} (online elementary school for homeschoolers) and grew it to {parseText("<bold>150,000 kids</bold>")} â€” like building a digital playground with {parseText("<bold>Ruby on Rails</bold>")} and lots of love. 
              
              Then there was {parseText("<bold>Visor</bold>")} â€” trained a real-time {parseText("<bold>computer vision model</bold>")} that coached you in Overwatch. We got {parseText("<italic>really</italic>")} big actually, then Blizzard banned us (oops ðŸ˜…). Classic David vs Goliath, except Goliath had lawyers.

              Was CTO at {parseText("<bold>Kanga</bold>")} where we built our own {parseText("<bold>ML models</bold>")} to recommend gamers content they'd vibe with â€” think Spotify for gaming content. Trained {parseText("<bold>open-source deep learning models</bold>")} for esports analytics (lots of {parseText("<bold>TensorFlow</bold>")} and late-night debugging sessions).

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Built random products for {parseText("<bold>League of Legends</bold>")} that hit {parseText("<bold>1M+ users</bold>")} (that dopamine hit was {parseText("<italic>unreal</italic>")}), shipped a dumb {parseText("<bold>AR menu app</bold>")} that went nowhere (but taught me {parseText("<bold>Swift</bold>")} and humility), and built a bunch of other random experiments â€” some {parseText("<bold>TypeScript</bold>")} here, some {parseText("<bold>Python</bold>")} there, all seasoned with curiosity.

              Sometimes I write about my {parseText("<bold>epic fails</bold>")} or when things went {parseText("<italic>absolutely right</italic>")}! If you want me to hit you up when I drop new content â€” {parseText("<bold>drop your email below</bold>")}. No spam, just real stories from the trenches.
