              I started my first company at 13 when I sold dragon ball z tenkaichi budokai 2 in 2009 on ebay.

              Selling stuff online turned into my high school obsession and I grew that company to
              $100K in revenue per year by expanding to products like these and these.

              Most recently, I was the founder of buildspace â€” it was the largest school in the world
              for people working on their own ideas from youtube videos to edm music to companies.

              During the company we scaled nights & weekends online to over 100,000 students,
              raised from a16z/yc, constructed a physical campus in sf for those that wanted to go
              full-time on their ideas, grew content to millions, and built an ai social product to help
              people find others like themselves trying to build stuff.

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Worked on the co for five years. But, I ended up closing it down. Here&apos;s a

              Founded an online elementary school called zipschool focused on homeschoolers and
              grew it to 150,000 kiddos, trained a real time cv model that would coach you in
              overwatch named visor (we got really big actually, then, blizzard banned us oops), was
              cto at kanga where we built our own models to recommend gamers content they&apos;d enjoy,
              trained my own open-source deep learning models for esports analytics, built random
              products for league of legends that got to 1m+ users, built a dumb ar menu app that got
              no where, and built a bunch of other random stupid shit that was meaningless but fun (lol).
