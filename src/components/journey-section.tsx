              Picture this: 13-year-old me discovering the **art of the flip** when I sold Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Budokai 2 in 2009 on eBay. *That first sale hit different* â€” like finding a rare drop in your favorite game.

              What started as pocket money turned into my **high school empire**. Scaled that hustle to **$100K/year** by expanding the catalog â€” think of it as building my own marketplace before I even knew what **React** or **APIs** were.

              Most recently, I founded **buildspace** â€” imagine the largest creative writing workshop, but for builders. We weren't just teaching; we were *cultivating a vibe* where YouTube creators, EDM producers, and startup founders all shared the same energy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              The numbers were **wild**: scaled nights & weekends online to **100,000+ students**, raised from **a16z/YC** (yeah, that happened), built a physical campus in SF that felt like a creative monastery, grew content that reached **millions**, and shipped an **AI social product** using **Next.js**, **Python**, and **PostgreSQL** to help people find their creative tribe.

              Five years of pure **flow state**. But sometimes the best songs end at their peak. I made the tough call to close it down. Here's a
              <a href="#" className="text-accent hover:underline ml-1">letter I wrote about it</a> â€” *raw and unfiltered*.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Buildspace was **magic**. Like that perfect playlist that just gets you. If you were part of it â€” **thank you**. You literally changed our lives.

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Founded **zipschool** (online elementary school for homeschoolers) and grew it to **150,000 kids** â€” like building a digital playground with **Ruby on Rails** and lots of love. 
              
              Then there was **Visor** â€” trained a real-time **computer vision model** that coached you in Overwatch. We got *really* big actually, then Blizzard banned us (oops ðŸ˜…). Classic David vs Goliath, except Goliath had lawyers.

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Was CTO at **Kanga** where we built our own **ML models** to recommend gamers content they'd vibe with â€” think Spotify for gaming content. Trained **open-source deep learning models** for esports analytics (lots of **TensorFlow** and late-night debugging sessions).
            </p>
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Built random products for **League of Legends** that hit **1M+ users** (that dopamine hit was *unreal*), shipped a dumb **AR menu app** that went nowhere (but taught me **Swift** and humility), and built a bunch of other random experiments â€” some **TypeScript** here, some **Python** there, all seasoned with curiosity.

            <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
              **Some stuff worked out. Most didn't.** But every failure was just another track in the learning playlist.

              Sometimes I write about my **epic fails** or when things went *absolutely right*! If you want me to hit you up when I drop new content â€” **drop your email below**. No spam, just real stories from the trenches.
