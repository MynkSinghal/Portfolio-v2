              </h2>

              <p>
                From movies to meals to motor vehicles - everything's on a
                subscription now.
                <br />
                Sounds convenient, right?
              </p>

              <p>
                But here's the catch: what looks like flexibility might just be
                a slow financial leak.
                <br />
                This post unpacks the rise of the <em>subscription economy</em>{" "}
                - the good, the bad, and the quietly dangerous.
              </p>

              <p>
                By the end, you'll know how to make smarter choices about the
                services you keep, ditch, or{" "}
                <em>never sign up for in the first place</em>.

                Instead of buying products outright, we now "rent" them on a
