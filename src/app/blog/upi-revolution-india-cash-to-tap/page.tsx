              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">🪝 From Kirana to Cloud: What Changed?</h2>

              <p>
                Back in 2016, India's economy was built on cash and chaos. Crumpled notes, long queues, no digital trail.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then came a three-letter disruption: <strong>UPI.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                Unified Payments Interface. Sounds dull. <em>But it rewired a nation.</em>
              </p>

              <p>
                By the end of this post, you'll know <strong>how UPI became India's financial lifeline</strong>, <strong>why it worked</strong>, and <strong>what's coming next.</strong> Plus, we'll meet real people who rode the wave.

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">⚡ The Click Heard Around the Country</h2>

              <p>UPI wasn't just another fintech experiment. It was a rebellion.</p>

              <p>
                While the rest of the world debated crypto, India was quietly building a seamless payment layer for everyone — from chaiwalas to CEOs.
              </p>

              <p>
                The NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) dropped a system that <strong>linked all your bank accounts to one app</strong>. Any bank. Any app. One tap.
              </p>

              <p>
                By 2020, we weren't just using UPI — we were living on it.<br />
                📈 <strong>2 billion+ transactions per month</strong>.<br />
                By 2023? <strong>7.3 billion</strong>. That's not growth. That's a cultural shift.
              </p>

              <hr className="border-foreground/20 my-8" />

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">👩‍💼 Rashmi's Store, Rashmi's Rules</h2>

              <p>Let's zoom in.</p>

              <p>
                Meet Rashmi — a textile shop owner in Uttar Pradesh.<br />
                Before UPI: counting notes, fearing theft, losing customers without exact change.<br />
                After UPI: scan, ping, done. Instant payments. More customers. <strong>More confidence.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>She didn't just adopt tech. She took control of her business.</p>

              <p>
                And she's not alone. Across rural India, farmers started getting subsidies <strong>directly in their UPI-linked accounts</strong> — no middlemen, no "missing funds."
              </p>

              <p>It wasn't just convenience. It was dignity.</p>

              <hr className="border-foreground/20 my-8" />

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">🔧 Why Did UPI Catch Fire?</h2>

              <p>Here's the breakdown:</p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
                <li>🏛 <strong>Policy Push:</strong> Digital India wasn't just a slogan — it became infrastructure.</li>
                <li>📱 <strong>Phones + Youth:</strong> With 65% under 35 and smartphones in their hands, India was ready.</li>
                <li>🤝 <strong>Partnerships That Clicked:</strong> Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm — each played their part in making UPI feel... effortless.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The design was genius: <strong>no passwords, no IFSC codes, no extra apps.</strong> Just your phone and your PIN.</p>

              <hr className="border-foreground/20 my-8" />

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">🌍 From Bazaar to Bharat to the World</h2>

              <p>UPI didn't just digitize payments — it <strong>reshaped the economy</strong>.</p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
                <li>💰 More formal transactions → better tax compliance.</li>
                <li>🧾 Clearer financial records → easier loans for small biz.</li>
                <li>🌐 Equal access → from metro malls to mountain villages.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>And it's just getting started.</p>

              <p>
                Countries like <strong>Singapore, UAE, and France</strong> are eyeing UPI as a model.<br />
                UPI 2.0 brings <strong>overdrafts, mandates, and even blockchain integration</strong>. This isn't a fad — it's financial infrastructure for the future.
              </p>

              <hr className="border-foreground/20 my-8" />

              <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">🚧 Still Loading: What Needs Fixing?</h2>

              <p>No tech is perfect.</p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
                <li>⚠️ <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> remains a growing concern.</li>
                <li>📚 <strong>Digital literacy</strong> still lags behind in rural pockets.</li>
                <li>🌐 <strong>Infrastructure gaps</strong> in remote areas create digital deserts.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The challenge ahead isn't scale — it's <strong>trust and teaching.</strong><br />
                If UPI is the highway, India needs to build the on-ramps.
