                ‚öôÔ∏è The Real-World Challenges SMEs Face
              </h2>

              <p>
                Let's start with the <em>messy reality</em>-running a small
                business in India is like playing chess on a bumpy train.
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
                <li>
                  <strong>Tech Isn't Everywhere:</strong> Many owners and
                  workers don't have the digital skills-or the budgets-to adopt
                  advanced tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Money Crunch:</strong> Getting loans or investment is
                  hard, so every rupee counts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Infrastructure Woes:</strong> Patchy power, slow
                  internet, and red tape slow everything down.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Skill Shortages:</strong> Finding people who "get"
                  both the business and new tech? Tough.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Marketing Limits:</strong> Most SMEs can't afford big
                  ad campaigns or global reach.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Think of it as building a skyscraper with hand tools-slow, but
                surprisingly sturdy.

                  <strong>Agility in Action:</strong> When COVID hit, many SMEs

                <li>

                SMEs aren't just "small"-they're <em>essential</em> to India's

                  <strong>Big Numbers:</strong> SMEs generate up to 45% of GDP
                  and employ over 60 million people.

                  <strong>Higher Costs:</strong> No bulk discounts or automation
                  means spending more per sale.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Brand Blindspots:</strong> It's tough to stand out or
