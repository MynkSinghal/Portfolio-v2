                If you've ever wondered who's actually running the show (and why
                you've never heard of them), this post is your backstage pass.
              </p>

              <p>
                While the world obsesses over social media clout, India's silent
                operators are building generational wealth in the shadows. By
                the end, you'll know why the country's true business powerhouses
                value substance over status-and how that mindset could change
                your own approach to building, scaling, and sustaining success.

                India's business backbone isn't built on viral posts-it's built
