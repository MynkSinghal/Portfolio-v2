                Now imagine doing that loop 10,000 times. Boom - that's how you

                <strong>Sarah, 23:</strong> Instead of spending months on one
                "perfect" app, she built and launched 12 mini-apps in one year.
                App #8 went viral. Total downloads: 500K+. Now runs her own
                studio.

                ‚ö° Breaking Through Common Iteration Blocks
              </h2>

              <p>
                <strong>"But what if my first iteration sucks?"</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                It will. That's the point. Every master was once a disaster at
                iteration #1.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>"What if people judge my early work?"</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                They're too busy worrying about their own work to judge yours.
                Ship anyway.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>
                  "What if I don't have time for multiple iterations?"
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                You don't have time NOT to iterate. One perfect attempt takes
                longer than five rough ones.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>"What if I'm not ready yet?"</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                You'll never be ready. Start iterating, and readiness will
                follow.
