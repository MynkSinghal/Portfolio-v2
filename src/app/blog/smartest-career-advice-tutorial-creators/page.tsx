                Let's face it-scrolling through YouTube tutorials or LinkedIn
                posts about "how to crack tech interviews" feels productive.
              </p>

              <p>Clear path. Actionable steps. Instant dopamine hit.</p>

              <p>
                It's comforting to follow creators who simplify everything into

              </h2>

              <p>In May 2022, someone made a bold claim:</p>

              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-foreground/20 pl-4 italic text-foreground/80 bg-foreground/5 p-4 rounded-r-lg">

              <p>üëÄ It sounded absurd.</p>
