          Everyone's busy optimizing their LinkedIn profiles. But here's the truth:<br />
          <strong>Most jobs in India don't even touch LinkedIn.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          They're born in living rooms, barber shops, and WhatsApp groups.<br />

          <strong>Why word-of-mouth is India's OG HR tech - and why it's not changing, no matter how many apps launch.</strong>

        </h2>

        <p>
          India's informal sector is the world's biggest.<br />
          That's not a flex - it's a reality check.
        </p>

        <p>
          You've got cooks, drivers, masons, gig workers - all hired without a single CV.<br />
          Their job interviews? "Kaam kaisa karta hai?" asked over chai.
        </p>

        <p>
          Forget "networking events." Here, the watchman's cousin is your next hire.<br />
          The contractor's village call is the real "talent pipeline."

          üßÉ WhatsApp Groups: India's Underground HR Engine
        </h2>

        <p>
          Corporate India loves its HRMS dashboards.<br />
          But real hiring? It's happening in society WhatsApp groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>"Need maid? Ping the group."</em><br />
          <em>"Looking for a driver? Ask the security guard."</em>
        </p>

        <p>Referral chains are wild:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li>A cook brings a cleaner</li>
          <li>Who brings a driver</li>
          <li>Who brings a gardener</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It's not a "platform." It's a living, breathing, trust-based web.

        </h2>

        <p>
          You think LinkedIn is "inclusive"?<br />
          Meet SEWA: 3.2 million women, 18 states, zero r√©sum√©s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Domestic work is run by women, for women.<br />
          Hiring happens through society whispers, not job fairs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Official stats say 4.75 million domestic workers.<br />
          Unofficial? Try 20‚Äì80 million.<br />
          Referral is the lifeblood - and the safety net.

        <p>
          Apna, Urban Company, WorkIndia - all promise to "disrupt" hiring.
        </p>

        <p>But here's what they can't hack:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li>Trust is built in person, not on ratings</li>
          <li>Speed matters (need a job <em>tomorrow</em>, not next week)</li>
          <li>English isn't the hiring language</li>
          <li>Fake offers and middlemen plague digital platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The watchman's word?<br />
          That's the only background check anyone needs.

        <p>
          The government is finally catching up:<br />
          e-Shram, ONDC, new labour codes - all trying to digitize trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here's the kicker:<br />
          Formalization adds social security, not new networks.<br />
          The hiring style? Still gossip, still WhatsApp, still "kaam dekha hai?"
        </p>

        <p>
          India's future of work will be digital, but the soul will always be human.

        <p>
          Next time you're updating your LinkedIn, ask yourself:<br />

        <p>
          Because in India, the best opportunities aren't posted online.<br />
          They're shared over chai, whispered in corridors, and passed through the most powerful network of all: trust.
