          üëÄ What If "Jugaad" Beats JavaScript?
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          You've been sold the dream: every business must have a dashboard, a CRM, and a Slack channel.
          But in the world's fastest-growing economy, "business as usual" looks like scribbled ledgers, missed calls, and trust that moves faster than any algorithm.
        </p>

        <p>
          This post?
          It's not a love letter to tech. It's a reality check:
          <strong> India's informal business systems are outsmarting digital tools - and nobody's ready to admit it.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          By the end, you'll see why "low-tech" is the new power move - and how the West's obsession with apps might just be a distraction.

          üß† The Invisible OS: Trust and Jugaad, Not Code
        </h2>

        <p>
          Let's get this straight:
          In India, <em>trust isn't a feature - it's the entire operating system</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Forget legal contracts and SaaS logins.
          Deals happen over chai, not checkboxes.
        </p>

        <p>
          450 million people work outside the formal payroll grid.
          Their "app"? A head full of names, a notebook, and a network that updates with every handshake.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li><strong>Jugaad</strong> isn't a buzzword. It's business MacGyver mode.</li>
          <li><strong>Udhaar</strong> (credit) is tracked in khata books, not on Salesforce.</li>
          <li>Power cut? No problem. A missed call or scribbled note keeps the wheels turning.</li>
        </ul>

          üí• WhatsApp: The Accidental ERP No One Saw Coming
        </h2>

        <p>
          Silicon Valley dreams of "super apps."
          India just uses WhatsApp.
        </p>

        <p>
          15 million+ small businesses run on it.
          Order-taking, catalogs, payments, customer support - all in one chat thread.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li>No new logins. No training.</li>
          <li>Works on any phone, even with data hiccups.</li>
          <li>Conversations feel human, not robotic.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Meta tried to "teach" shopkeepers how to use it.
          Turns out, they were already running circles around most SaaS teams.

          üé≠ Why Slack, SaaS, and CRMs Flop in the Real World
        </h2>

        <p>
          Here's the dirty secret:
          Most global tools assume you've got 24/7 power, blazing-fast internet, and a love for clicking dropdowns.
        </p>

        <p>
          India?
          Try spotty data, daily power cuts, and a deep allergy to complexity.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li>A third of users have no data plan.</li>
          <li>Laptops? Rare. Pen and paper? Everywhere.</li>
          <li>Cloud-only apps die when the lights flicker.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Tally (yep, desktop ledger software) still dominates.
          Why? Because it works offline and respects the hustle.

        </h2>

        <p>
          Startups saw gold in "digitizing" Indian business.
          Millions downloaded Khatabook and Dukaan.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here's the twist:
          People use these apps as helpers - not replacements.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li>Khatabook digitizes the khata, but doesn't kill the notebook.</li>
          <li>Dukaan lets shops go online, but calls and WhatsApps still close the deals.</li>
          <li>Adoption spikes for GST filings, then drops back to "call bhaiya."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The winners?
          Tools that <em>fold into habits</em> - not bulldoze them.

          üßµ Weddings, Warehouses, and Vendor Networks: Where Real Business Happens

        <p>This isn't theory. It's Tuesday.</p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li>Weddings: Dozens of vendors, all on WhatsApp and calls. No Slack, no Trello, just trust.</li>

          <li>D2C brands: Orders, payments, and fights handled via missed calls and spreadsheets. CRMs? LOL.</li>

        <p>
          The West is obsessed with automation and audit trails.
          India?
          Resilience and adaptability are the real flex.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
