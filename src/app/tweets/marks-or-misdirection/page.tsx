          üëÄ The Career Guidance Mirage: Why Nobody's Telling You What's Possible
        </h2>

        <p>
          You know how everyone says, "Beta, follow your passion"?<br />
          Now ask them to name 10 careers.<br />
          Watch the silence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's the real twist:<br />
          <strong>93% of Indian students can't name more than 7 career options.</strong><br />
          Not because they're lazy - because nobody ever showed them the map.

          üé≠ The Stream Trap: Choose Your Fate - Blindfolded
        </h2>

        <p>
          At 15, you pick Science, Arts, or Commerce.<br />
          It's like picking a cricket team without knowing who plays what position.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why?<br />
          Because schools hand you a menu, but never the ingredients.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Science and Arts hog 40% each. Commerce? Stuck at 14% for a decade.</strong><br />
          Not because students love periodic tables or poetry - but because "marks ke hisaab se le lo, beta."

          üí• The Counseling Desert: 1 Lakh Counselors for 315 Million Kids
        </h2>

        <p>
          India needs 1.4 million career counselors.<br />
          We have maybe 1 lakh.<br />
          That's one counselor for every 1000+ students - the recommended is 1:250.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, who's guiding your future?<br />
          Mostly, nobody.<br />
          When guidance does show up, it's a one-time "career day" - not a real roadmap.

        </h2>

        <p>
          Why does every Science kid end up in BTech?<br />
          Because it's the only door anyone points to.
        </p>

        <p>
          12 lakh kids wrote JEE.<br />
          Only 10% of engineering grads will land jobs.<br />
          Even at IITs, placements are dropping.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mechanical Engineering seats go empty.<br />
          Computer Science is packed - not by passion, but by panic.

          üß† Commerce: The Stream Nobody Sells
        </h2>

        <p>
          Commerce has been stuck at 14% forever.<br />
          Not because it's boring - but because nobody markets its magic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ask a student: Commerce = CA or MBA, right?<br />
          But fintech, analytics, digital marketing?<br />
          Blank stares.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though 70% of women commerce grads are employable, the stream still feels "invisible."

          üîç Dreams Deferred: When System Design Wastes Talent
        </h2>

        <p>
          20% of youth have zero career clarity.<br />
          Half don't have a single role model in their dream field.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kids switch streams after results, drop out of engineering, or finish degrees and say, "Yeh toh main nahi karna chahta tha."

          Every switch is wasted time, lost money, and broken confidence.

          üí• Dropout Domino: When Confusion = Exit
        </h2>

        <p>
          India's secondary school dropout rate? 12.6%.<br />
          In Punjab (where guidance exists), dropouts are 1.5%.<br />
          In the Northeast (where it doesn't), it's 25%+.
        </p>

        <p>
          Poverty matters, yes.<br />
          But so does career confusion.<br />
          Kids don't leave because they're weak - they leave because they see no path.

          The fix isn't more marks or harder exams.<br />
          It's real exposure, real counselors, and real talk about what's possible.
