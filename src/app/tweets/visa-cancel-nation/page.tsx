          üëÄ America's New Game: Deport First, Ask Questions Never
        </h2>

        <p>
          Let's cut the sugar: If you thought the US immigration system was a maze, welcome to the new level - where the walls move, the rules change mid-game, and the exit signs point straight to the airport.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't just about <strong>"illegal"</strong> vs. <strong>"legal"</strong> anymore. It's about anyone with a visa, a dream, and - god forbid - a traffic ticket.
        </p>

        <p>
          You're about to see why the world's sharpest students and techies are suddenly living like fugitives, and what it means for anyone betting their future on the American Dream.

          üí• The "Catch & Revoke" Era: Where Your Past Is a Loaded Gun
        </h2>

        <p>
          Remember when "Build the Wall" was the headline? Now it's <strong>"Catch & Revoke"</strong> - and the net is wide.
        </p>

        <p>
          One minor brush with the law? Congrats, you're on ICE's radar. Paid that parking fine in 2021? Doesn't matter. Priya, a PhD student, got her visa yanked for a ticket she'd already settled - <em>four years ago</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new rule: <strong>Any police interaction = potential deportation</strong>. No context, no mercy, no do-overs.

          Meet Stephen Miller - the architect of this chaos. His motto? <strong>"America is for Americans and Americans only."</strong>

          <li><strong>Indians = 1/3 of all foreign students</strong></li>

          <li><strong>50% of recent student visa revocations</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Translation: If you're Indian, you're the main character in this horror show.
        </p>

        <p>
          Scammers smell the fear. Fake "immigration officers" are extorting lakhs from students, threatening blacklists and deportation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shria Bi lost <strong>‚Çπ4.2 lakhs</strong> to a scammer. The real kicker? The threat felt real - because it is.
