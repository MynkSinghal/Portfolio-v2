        </h2>

        <p>
          Let's rip the Band-Aid: <strong>90% of startups in India face-plant within five years.</strong><br />
          Meanwhile, that dosa guy on the corner? He's <em>printing cash</em> and probably knows your lunch order better than your co-founder knows your product roadmap.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't just a spicy take-it's a wake-up call.<br />
          We're about to break down how <strong>India's street vendors are quietly dunking on boardroom geniuses</strong>, and what you (yes, you) can steal from their playbook.

        <p>
          Here's the plot twist:<br />
          While <strong>VCs set fire to ‚Çπ468 crores in seed funding</strong> just to watch 90% of their bets vanish, street vendors are running ultra-lean, high-survival businesses-with a <strong>failure rate that's 9x lower</strong>.

          Startups love to "iterate." Street vendors <em>live</em> it.

        <p>
          <em>You're running A/B tests. He's adjusting spice levels on the fly-while making change and remembering who hates onions.</em>

          üçî Unit Economics: The Street Vendor Cheat Code
        </h2>

        <p>
          Let's talk numbers-because vibes don't pay rent.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
          <li><strong>Setup cost?</strong> Street vendor: ‚Çπ50k‚Äì2 lakh. Cloud kitchen: ‚Çπ5‚Äì10 lakh, easy.</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly rent?</strong> Street vendor: basically zero. Cloud kitchen: ‚Çπ25k‚Äì‚Çπ50k.</li>
          <li><strong>Staff?</strong> Vendor = solo grind. Cloud kitchen = payroll headache.</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue?</strong> Vendor clears ‚Çπ3 lakh/month with margins that'd make a VC sweat.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The result?<br />
          Street vendors win on <em>every</em> cost line except revenue-and they still walk away with more profit per rupee invested.

          Founders brag about "pivoting."<br />
          Street vendors <em>don't have the luxury of slow mistakes</em>.

        <p>
          Meanwhile, SaaS startups take 18 months to change direction.<br />
          By then, the momo guy's already tested five new fillings and doubled his regulars.

        <p>
          Street vendors run on <strong>trust and memory</strong>-the kind you can't buy with an ad budget.
