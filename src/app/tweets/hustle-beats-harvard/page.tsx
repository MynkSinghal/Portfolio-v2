This thread breaks down why hustle > Harvard in India's real economy.

(1/n)

90% of Indian startups crash and burn within five years.

The dosa guy on your street? Still printing cash.

The real business masterclass isn't in boardrooms, it's on the pavement.

(2/n)

Startups burn crores, pivot slow, and pray for product-market fit.

Street vendors? They adapt in real time, survive on cash flow, and pivot before you finish your A/B test.

Survival > strategy when the customer is two feet away.

(3/n)

The bhel puri seller tweaks his recipe in 18 seconds flat.

Startups take 18 months to pivot.

CRM? 

Try memory-based loyalty: "extra strong, no sugar" for Mohan sir, no SaaS required.

(4/n)

Street vendors start with â‚¹50kâ€“2L, pay almost no rent, and profit from day one.

Cloud kitchens burn through lakhs before seeing a rupee.

Low overhead isn't luck, it's an unfair advantage.

(5/n)

Paan shops add new products in hours.

Food trucks chase foot traffic daily.

While SaaS founders debate pivots, the momo guy's already tested five new fillings.

Adaptation isn't a feature, it's survival.

(6/n)

Street vendors build trust face-to-face, not through ads or algorithms.

They remember regulars, create real value, and pivot fast.

Real loyalty is built in the gaps algorithms can't see.

(7/n)

ðŸ“Š Failure rates:

Street vendors: 10%
VC-backed startups: 75%
General startups: 90%

Food e-commerce? Even $56M-funded giants get wiped out.

The streets never left the customer's side.
