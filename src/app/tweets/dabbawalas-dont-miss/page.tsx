          üëÄ Why You Should Care About 5,000 Men in White (And Why Silicon Valley Is Nervous)
        </h2>

        <p>
          Let's get real:<br />
          You trust apps to bring you food, but Mumbai's dabbawalas have been running a <strong>200,000-meal relay</strong> for 135 years - with <strong>no GPS, no apps, no excuses</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          While your delivery app is busy "finding a rider," these guys are already halfway across the city, dodging monsoons and traffic jams, with a <strong>Six Sigma error rate</strong> that would put NASA to shame.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't nostalgia. It's a <strong>masterclass in human systems</strong> - and it's eating Big Tech's lunch.

          üßÉ The Secret Code: When "B 5 W 6N2" Beats Your QR Scanner
        </h2>

        <p>
          Forget barcodes.<br />
          Dabbawalas use a <strong>handwritten code</strong> that looks like random scribbles but runs a city-wide ballet.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>B</em> (Borivali West), <em>5</em> (Churchgate), <em>W</em> (west), <em>6N2</em> (building/floor).<br />
          No addresses. No Google Maps. Just <strong>mental muscle memory</strong> and a color-coded lid.
        </p>

        <p>
          They sort, swap, and relay 200,000 tiffins daily - all on the backs of trains and cycles.

          üß† Harvard, Meet the Human Algorithm: When MBAs Study the Men in White

        <p>
          Forbes called it: <strong>99.999999% accuracy</strong>.<br />
          That's one mistake in 16 million.
        </p>

        <p>
          Harvard wrote a case study.<br />
          FedEx execs flew in, hoping to steal the secret sauce.
        </p>

        <p>
          The twist?<br />
          Most dabbawalas are <strong>semi-literate</strong>. Their "algorithm" is a relay of trust, not code.
        </p>

          üßµ Stories in Steel: Lunchboxes That Carry Love, Cash, and Apology Notes

        <p>
          These aren't just lunchboxes.<br />
          They're <strong>love letters, salary packets, and at times, quiet bridge between hearts.</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One day it's a wife's apology note.<br />
          Another, it's a customer's entire paycheck - trusted to the dabbawala, not the bank.
        </p>

        <p>
          They even run food banks and charity drives, redistributing leftovers to the hungry.<br />

          Mumbai floods?<br />
          Dabbawalas wade through waist-deep water, tiffins held high.

          Terror attacks?<br />
          They keep moving, because "error is horror."

          COVID?<br />
          The city shut down, but the dabbawalas pivoted - delivering restaurant meals, launching digitaldabbawala.com, and even joining Flipkart's last-mile army.
