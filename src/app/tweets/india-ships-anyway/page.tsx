            Here's the spicy truth: India spends a mind-bending <Bold>14% of its GDP</Bold> just moving stuff around.<br />
            That's nearly double what the "efficient" West pays.<br />
            Yet‚Äîsomehow‚Äîyour package still lands in your village, rain or <Italic>bandh</Italic>.<br />
            Forget best practices. This is <Italic>Bharat's shipping jungle</Italic>‚Äîand chaos is the secret sauce.
