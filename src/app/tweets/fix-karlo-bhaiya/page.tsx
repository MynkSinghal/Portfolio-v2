          <p>
            This isn't a sob story about scarcity.
            It's a masterclass in <em>resourceful abundance</em> - how India's "fix it first" mindset fuels jobs, innovation, and even climate wins.
            You'll see why repair is not just a backup plan - it's a billion-dollar blueprint for economic continuity.

          <p>
            India's repair sector is a financial beast.
            Electronics repair alone? $20 billion by next year.
            Add auto parts, cobblers, phone shops, and the recycling mafia - you've got a parallel economy that outlasts recessions and outsmarts planned obsolescence.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Every time you patch a phone or mend a shoe, you're plugging into a system that employs millions - and keeps the country running when everything else stalls.

          <p>
            In the West, broken means bin.
            In India, broken means "let's see what we can salvage."
            Jugaad isn't just a meme - it's an operating system.
            Cobblers swap soles, mobile-wallas mix and match parts from three brands, and even the Tata Nano ($2,000 car) was born from frugal, fix-first thinking.

            When you run on scarcity, you build muscle for innovation.

          <p>
            Think mochi = just shoes?
            Wrong. Mochis are legacy coders - fixing, adapting, and now launching brands like "Ramchet Mochi" online.
            Meanwhile, India's 80,000+ phone repair shops are the new digital mandis.
            They're not just fixing tech - they're keeping families connected, businesses alive, and e-waste out of landfills.

          <p className="mt-4">

          <p>
            Dharavi isn't just a slum.
            It's Asia's recycling HQ, processing 80% of Mumbai's plastic waste.
            Here, every discarded bottle is a business opportunity.
            From mattress stuffing to chemical drums, nothing dies - everything gets a second life.

          <p className="mt-4">
            This isn't charity. It's the purest form of circular economy - run by entrepreneurs in flip-flops.

          <p>
            Here's the paradox:
            Repair work keeps India ticking, but it's still looked down on.
            Cobblers, mechanics, waste collectors - they're the backbone, but treated like background noise.
            Yet, when crisis hits (hello, COVID), these are the folks who adapt, survive, and even start new micro-businesses in record time.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Maybe it's time we stop seeing repair as "low-status" and start seeing it as "future-proof."

          <p>
            In India, a mended bicycle isn't just a ride - it's a family's daily bread.
            A fixed phone isn't just tech - it's a lifeline for a migrant worker.
            We don't just repair objects; we repair memories, livelihoods, and trust.

          <p className="mt-4">
            That's why "fix karlo" wins against "buy new."

          <p>
            Next time something breaks, pause before you bin it.
            Ask yourself: Is this just about saving cash - or saving a system?
            Because in India, every repair is a small revolution.
