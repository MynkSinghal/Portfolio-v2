const threadContent = `🚨 The next billion-dollar Indian startup isn't in Bangalore or Mumbai. 

It's brewing in Bhilai, Indore, Surat, quietly rewriting the rules of business genius from the heartland. 

Here's how Tier-2 cities are eating metro's lunch.

(1/n)

🪄 The myth is dead: Innovation has left the glass towers. 

45% of new Indian startups now emerge from Tier-2 & 3 cities. 

The new unicorns? Born in small-town chaos, scaling with ruthless efficiency.

(2/n)

📊 Bhilwara's startup growth? 181% YoY. 

Moradabad, Bareilly, Srinagar, triple-digit surges. 

Metros still hog funding, but Nagpur, Ahmednagar, Vadodara now see bigger average deals. 

The map is flipping.

(3/n)

🤝 Indore's secret sauce: real community, not corporate noise. 

Startups here grow from 16 founders in a coffee shop to 50+ running citywide workshops. 

Authenticity > hype, every time.

(4/n)

💡 Surat went from diamonds to digital. 

Local iLab, backed by the city, is India's first urban-run startup engine. 

They're not "catching up", they're leapfrogging with AI, e-comm, and raw hustle.

(5/n)

🏰 Jaipur's playbook? Heritage meets high-tech.

 Startups like DealShare moved from Bengaluru to Jaipur to stay close to real customers. 

Proximity = insight. That's how you outsmart the metros.

(6/n)

🦾 Bhilai, the steel city, is now a tech lab. 

Bootstrapped food startups, mining drones, and IoT solutions, without metro price tags or VC handouts.

Proof: ₹95 lakh revenue, global exports, zero outside funding.

(7/n)

💸 The Tier-2 cheat code: cost. Surat offices = ₹30–50/sqft; Mumbai = ₹100–150. 

Talent costs up to 40% less, and loyalty runs deeper. 

Runway = longer, stress = lower, focus = sharper.

(8/n)

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family businesses aren't "old school"—they're anti-fragile. 70% of Indian enterprises are family-run, blending tradition with digital scale. 

By 2050, they could power 80% of India's GDP.

(9/n)

🗣️ The language revolution: Only 125M Indians speak English. 540M+ use regional tongues. 

Tier-2 founders build in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, unlocking a $53B market metros barely see.

(10/n)

🛠️ Jugaad isn't just frugal, it's a superpower. Small-town founders hack constraints into creative gold. 

Example: A tier-3 delivery startup outlasts Zomato by knowing every local alley.

(11/n)

🌐 Rural internet is the great equalizer. By 2025, 504M rural Indians will be online. 

Tier-2 startups, fluent in local needs, are poised to win this digital landgrab.

(12/n)

🚀 The future of Indian innovation isn't in a metro. It's in a Tier-2 city where cost, culture, and creativity collide. 

The next unicorn? Already being built far from the spotlight.
