const threadContent = `ðŸ”¥ Before Netflix, India didn't binge-watch.
It waited.
Every Sunday morning, the whole nation paused for a show.

Here's how India's watching habits changed â€” and what we lost in the process.

(1/n)

ðŸ“º The TV wasn't a screen.
It was a shrine.

Families gathered. Neighbours brought stools.
One show = one colony watching together.
Ramayan on Sundays felt like a national festival.

Now? You watch in bed. Alone.

(2/n)

ðŸ§’ Cartoons weren't "content."
They were imagination, morality, and magic.

Shaktimaan taught right from wrong.
Shaka Laka Boom Boom made dreams tangible.
Every show felt like a message with meaning.

(3/n)

ðŸŽµ Even ads were events.
Washing Powder Nirma. Dhara's jalebi boy. Fevicol. Dairy Milk.

You didn't skip them.
You sang them. You felt them.

Today's 5-sec skippables can't match that emotional grip.

(4/n)

ðŸŽ¤ Reality shows = real emotions.
Indian Idol. KBC. DID.

You didn't just watch.
You voted. You cried. You felt like family.

"SMS karo apne sapne jeetne ke liye"
Now it's: "Next episode in 5 seconds."

(5/n)

ðŸ“¡ Cable killed collectiveness.
DTH gave every room its own remote.

Dad = sports.
Mom = serials.
Kids = cartoons.

And just like that â€” shared TV time fragmented into solo screen time.

(6/n)

ðŸ“² Then came Jio. And OTT.

Suddenly, 1 screen turned into 1B phones.
TV left the living room.
Now it lives in your pocket.

Binge. Alone.
No waiting. No family. No ritual.

(7/n)

ðŸ‘€ TV used to be about togetherness.
Today, it's just convenience.

From "Sab saath baith ke dekhenge"
To "Tu dekh le, mujhe mat bataana spoiler"

We gained access.
But lost connection.

(8/n)

ðŸ§  Content changed.
But so did how we consume.

From:
â€” Scheduled shows â†’ Infinite scroll
â€” Joint watching â†’ Solo streams
â€” Shared emotion â†’ Personalized algorithm

This wasn't just media evolution.
It was a cultural shift.

(9/n)

ðŸ“š What we lost:
â€” The joy of waiting
â€” The power of ritual
â€” The warmth of shared emotion
â€” A generation raised by one story at a time

Now?
We're alone.
Scrolling. Drowning in choice.
