const threadContent = `üí∏ A ‚Çπ10 note is poor man's UPI.
Ignored by banks, worshipped by sabziwalas, folded 1000 times ‚Äî never replaced.
This is the secret life of India's most hardworking note.

(1/n)

üõ†Ô∏è ‚Çπ10 is born in RBI's printing presses ‚Äî not plastic, but cotton-soaked cloth.
It's printed with care‚Ä¶
Only to end up crushed in someone's blouse or autorickshaw dashboard.

(2/n)

üè¶ It enters circulation through banks ‚Äî but here's the twist:
ATMs hate ‚Çπ10 notes.
They jam machines, take too much space, and aren't "cost-effective."

So guess where they go?
Your local chai tapri.

(3/n)

üçµ From mandis to metro trains, this note is everywhere.
Chai stalls, paan shops, school canteens.
It flows where QR codes don't.
Not flashy ‚Äî but functional.

(4/n)

üîÅ Vendors prefer ‚Çπ10 notes.
Digital is great, but what if signal's gone? Or the uncle doesn't know how to "scan"?
‚Çπ10 is instant. Tangible. Trustable.

It makes small biz run without any app update.

(5/n)

üìâ Everyone talks about UPI.
But ‚Çπ10 cash demand is RISING.
India is short by 500+ crore notes.
Even RBI brought back ‚Çπ10 coins ‚Äî people still don't like them.

They want the note. Not the metal.

(6/n)

üñäÔ∏è ‚Çπ10 isn't just money.
It's a notepad. A bookmark. A message board.
People scribble grocery lists, phone numbers, even mantras on it.

No other object carries such casual intimacy.

(7/n)

‚ôªÔ∏è After 3‚Äì5 years, the note dies.
Banks sort them. RBI shreds them.
No recycling. Just quiet disappearance.

No one thanks it.
But for years, it held India's informal economy together.

(8/n)

üí• In the battle between code and cash, ‚Çπ10 survives not because it's smart ‚Äî
But because it's understood.
It's not "legacy."
It's infrastructure.

A living, breathing node in India's daily trade.
