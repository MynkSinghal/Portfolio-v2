const threadContent = `ðŸ›• Temples don't just serve God.

They serve 100 million Indians â€” daily.

From langars to â‚¹10 sabjis, India's real welfare isn't run by the state.

It's run by faith.

(1/n)

The Golden Temple in Amritsar feeds 100,000 people every single day.

No ticket.
No income proof.
No subsidy.

Just stainless steel plates and pure operations.

(2/n)

Gurudwaras became India's emergency kitchens during COVID.

Police, migrant workers, slum dwellers â€” all fed without a form.

No OTP. No app. Just roti and warmth.

(3/n)

Temples offer water.
Shelter.
Shade.

Sometimes even free medical camps.

They don't call it "service delivery."
They just call it "seva."

(4/n)

Chennai's Amma Canteens serve full meals for â‚¹10.

Inspired by temple kitchens.

No margin. No upsell. No branding.

Just the belief that food = dignity.

(5/n)

India has no universal meal scheme for adults.

But temples, mosques, churches, and gurudwaras?

They've been running one for centuries.

Decentralized. Local. Human.

(6/n)

Faith institutions don't just preach.

They:
â€“ Feed cities
â€“ Employ workers
â€“ Host relief camps
â€“ Provide mental and social safety

In India, faith is infrastructure.

(7/n)

We always ask: "Why isn't the government doing more?"

But here's the real question:

If a gurudwara can serve 100,000 daily â€”
what's stopping the state?
