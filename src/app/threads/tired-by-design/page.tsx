const threadContent = `ðŸ”¥ Tired all the time?

It's not just your job.

It's your city.

From traffic to toilets - Indian cities are designed to drain you.

Here's how poor urban planning quietly exhausts 1.4 billion people.

(1/n)

Our cities weren't built for people.

They were built for vehicles.

Try walking in most Indian towns - it's cracked footpaths, honking chaos, and zero safety.

Speed won. Safety lost.

(2/n)

Your 2-hour daily commute?

That's not just time lost.

It's health lost, joy lost, peace lost.

And if you're a woman?
Every ride = risk.

Indian commuting isn't movement. It's mental taxation.

(3/n)

Need a break?
Too bad.

Benches? Rare.

Public toilets? Scarce.

Shade? Only if a tree escaped the axe.

Our cities are built for motion, not pause.

Stillness is punished.

(4/n)

Disabled? Elderly? Pregnant?
Good luck.

No ramps. No rails. No access.

Cities assume strength and youth.

Forget inclusion - they're barely functional.

(5/n)

Poor design isn't cheap.

It costs us:
â€“ More hospital visits
â€“ Fewer work hours
â€“ Lost mobility for women, elders, kids

The real price of planning is what we lose daily.

(6/n)

Look closer.
Some neighborhoods have footbridges, footpaths, flyovers.

Others don't even have drains.

Cities don't serve people equally.

They serve power.

(7/n)

So ask yourself:

What would our cities look likeâ€¦
if we built them for humans, not traffic?
