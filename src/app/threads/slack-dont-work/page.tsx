const threadContent = `üî• India's billion-dollar businesses run on missed calls, scribbled notes, and pure trust - not Slack or Salesforce.

Why "low-tech" hacks beat enterprise software in the world's fastest-growing economy.

(1/n)

üí° 450 million Indians work outside the formal system.
 Deals happen on word-of-mouth, reputation, and "jugaad" - not dashboards.

Trust is the real operating system here.

(2/n)

‚öôÔ∏è WhatsApp isn't just for chatting.

It's India's accidental ERP: 15M+ businesses use it for catalogs, orders, payments, and credit - all in one thread.

No training, no downloads, just business.

(3/n)

üß† Slack, SaaS, and CRMs?
Most tools assume perfect power, fast internet, and tech skills.

But India's reality = patchy broadband, power cuts, and a love for simplicity.

Offline beats online every time.

(4/n)

üèóÔ∏è Khatabook and Dukaan got millions of signups digitizing ledgers and storefronts.

But most users treat them as helpers - not replacements.

If it doesn't fold into daily habits, it won't last.

(5/n)

üõ†Ô∏è Real life:
Weddings run on WhatsApp groups and calls, not Slack.

Warehouses use paper and group chats, not dashboards.

D2C brands handle orders in spreadsheets and missed calls, not a CRM.

(6/n)

üß≠ "Efficiency" in India means whatever works when the lights go out.

Personal trust and flexible hacks scale faster than any process or platform.

Low-tech isn't a weakness - it's a strategy.
