const threadContent = `üî• Indian schools teach you how to score marks.

But never how to make choices.

This is why so many students are brilliant‚Ä¶ and still confused.

Let's unpack the real education gap nobody talks about.

#IndianEducation #CareerGuidance #EducationMatters  #IndiaUntold

(üßµ1/n)

üéØ You're 15. You pick Science, Commerce, or Arts.

It feels like a big decision.

But no one tells you what that choice actually unlocks.

You're picking from a menu, without seeing the food.

(2/n)

üß™ Science = Engineering.

That's the default.

Not because every kid loves tech  but because no one shows them options.

Design, biotech, research, policy? Never mentioned.

It's not a stream. It's a funnel.

(3/n)

üìä Commerce = BBA, BCA, MBA.

Ask around and you'll see the pattern.

Because nobody talks about finance, economics, VC, journalism, analytics‚Ä¶

So students follow the crowd.
Not curiosity.

(4/n)

üß≠ Career counseling?

Mostly one seminar a year.

400 students. One speaker.

No maps. No mentors. Just marks.

We teach chemistry.

But not the chemistry of choosing.

(5/n)

üß† Students do ask the right questions:

"What can I do with this subject?"

"Is there a creative option for commerce?"

But schools reward performance, not exploration.

(6/n)

üë©‚Äçüè´ What if education meant exposure?

Bring real professionals to school.

Let students shadow careers.

Let them explore options before they're locked into them.

That's how you build clarity, not confusion.

(7/n)

üí° Scoring 95% is great.

But if students graduate without knowing what excites them, what's the point?

Ambition isn't just about marks.

It's about direction.
